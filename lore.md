Las Islas Filipinas exists in a unique universe where the history of the islands and its people follows a path very different from that of the real world.

In this universe, the oppression, discrimination, and marginalization of people based on race, heritage, skin color, gender, class, or sexuality never took place. While historical events and figures can still serve as inspiration, any conflict or harm based on these factors has never occurred.

Though cruelty, violence, and greed still persist in this universe, conflicts arise not from personal differences, but over power, resources, and wealth. Nations still rise and fall, but humanity's struggles are rooted in ambition, not hatred or division.
